# GANs with PyTorch

This project implements Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) using PyTorch.  
It demonstrates how to train a generator and discriminator from scratch to create synthetic data.  

## Features
- Custom implementation of GAN architecture
- PyTorch-based training loop
- Easy-to-run Jupyter notebook
